* I've coded in JavaScript last year
* I'm taking this class because I wanted to continue to learn about computer science and coding.
* Outside of coding I run cross country, play basketball and tennis
* One goal for the class is to begin learning new coding languages
* I'm worried about not making simple mistakes that mess up my entire code
